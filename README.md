# News Sources

Rather than subscribe to dozens of newsletters via email, I found a better way: subscribe to RSS feeds and aggregate everything in one place. I suggest Feedly for this. It has a web application and smartphone (iOS or Android) app. This makes it easier to scroll through hundreds of headlines quickly.

I use Pocket Casts on iOS. Mainly because it is one of the few that can also handle playing audiobooks in mp3 format.
